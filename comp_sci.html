                <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
                <p>Computer Science offers a deep dive into the essentials of computational theory. This field is not
                    just about coding, it’s about solving complex problems developing new ways to interact with
                    technology and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

                <h2>What you'll learn</h2>
                <p>Computer science at Derby offers students a course filled with knowledge on the theory aspect of
                    computer science, with a strong emphasis on practical projects using cutting-edge software in the
                    professional laboratories on campus.</p>
                <p>
                    Students can expect to learn about developing high-quality software in our specialist facility labs,
                    such as the XR (Cross-reality) lab whereby students can develop games and visualise various software
                    projects, the CAVE lab which allows students to project video and sound in a 270 degree Virtual
                    Reality environment, and the Makers space where students can work on their personal projects and
                    make prototypes.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- whats next? section -->
            <div class="next">
                <h2>What's next?</h2>
                <p>After completing this course, a wide range of career opportunities will become available including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Software engineer</li>
                    <li>Data analyst</li>
                    <li>Web developer</li>
                    <li>Many other opportunities as a degree in computer science can open up pathways to more careers in
                        thetechnology field.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Employers love experience! Thankfully, UoD offers students the chance to explore many graduate
                    programmes, as well as providing their own placement year options!</p>

            <!-- why now? section -->
            <div class="why">
                <h2>Why start now?</h2>
                <p>Computer science as a whole is a great opportunity for students to consider due to the variety of
                    career options and the extensive job market. Computer scientists are needed in most industries as
                    humans steer more toward a world with technological aid. Computer systems and software are
                    constantly evolving which will require specialists far into the future.</p>
